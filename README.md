# Flipping-Flashcards
This project's idea was to create a study tool that:
- imitates the behaviour of a real flashcard
- can be customized with user-generated sets of questions and answers
- allows the user to indicate their level of knowledge and devote more time to low-rated flashcards

## How to
1. Select a set of questions from the drop-down menu or upload a custom .csv or .json file (examples included).
1. Click the flashcard to flip to the answer side.
1. Did you know the answer? Using the stars at the bottom, rate your knowledge: ☆ - none; ☆☆ - partial; ☆☆☆ - perfect.
1. The rating you select affects how often you'll see the same flashcard.
1. 3 ratings of "perfect" (3 stars) or 6 ratings of "partial" removes the card from rotation in the current session.
1. Change the flashcard set at any time by clicking the refresh button.
